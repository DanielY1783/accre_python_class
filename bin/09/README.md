## Exercises
Add some functionality to our DiceSet class:
1. Implement the count_attempts method that we skipped in class
2. Implement maximum and minimum methods that return the max and min possible roll from the set
3. Implement a range method that returns a list of all possible values rolled by the set. Use this to improve count_attempts to raise an exception immediately if the value is impossible
4. Write unit tests for the DiceSet class using pytest.

**Note** 
Parts 1-3 are in src/ folder, while part 4 is in test/ folder.
