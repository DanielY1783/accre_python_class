# Description: My solution to the below exercise posed by Eric Appelt (unit
# tests are in the ../../tests folder):
#
# Exercise: Do some Test-Driven Development (TDD):
#
# Define a function that takes a positive integer and returns the double
# factorial. The double factorial is defined differently for even and odd
# numbers. For example, 9!! = 9 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 and 6!! = 6 * 4 * 2. * The
# double factorial of zero is 0!! = 1. Don’t actually implement the function,
# just define it in a module and add a nice docstring. Otherwise leave the
# function body blank.
#
# Now write some unit tests for the function that you haven’t implemented
# yet. These tests should check that the function returns the right value for
# 0, 1, 2, and a larger even and odd number. They should also make sure that
# a ValueError is raised for a negative number. Run the tests, which should
# all fail.
#
# Implement the function body to return the correct double factorial. When
# you think you have done this correctly, run the test to ensure the
# validity of your implementation.

def double_factorial():
    pass
